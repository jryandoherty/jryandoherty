                <p>If you have a new company or and old company or perhaps a boring company -- you need a website that "pops". Ok, I hate that term. It's meaningless. What you really need is a custom design approach based on research, data and introspection.</p>

                    <p>So that Wordpress site and theme looked super-easy to get going. And logos are easy too. Well, guess what? That stuff is way harder than it looks. Calm down, I'll fix it.</p>
